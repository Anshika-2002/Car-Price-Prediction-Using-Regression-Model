# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Regression-Model
Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict the selling price of cars using various attributes such as fuel type, transmission type, seller type, and more. The dataset is processed and used to train a Linear Regression model that estimates the price of a car based on these features. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to predict continuous values, specifically car prices.

Technologies Used
Python (Programming Language)
Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
NumPy (Numerical operations)
Matplotlib (Data visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine learning and model evaluation)
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various car features, including:

Fuel_Type: Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
Seller_Type: Type of seller (Dealer, Individual)
Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual, Automatic)
Selling_Price: The target variable, the selling price of the car.
The dataset is pre-processed by handling categorical values, encoding them into numerical values, and splitting it into training and test data.

Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction

2. Install Dependencies:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

3. Dataset: Ensure you have the car_data.csv file in the project directory.
4. Run the Script:
 python car_price_prediction.py

How the Model Works
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: If any missing values are present in the dataset, they are handled accordingly.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical data (Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission) is encoded to numerical values using label encoding.
2. Feature Selection
Target Variable: The target variable is Selling_Price, which is separated from the feature set.
Feature Set: The remaining columns (Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, and others) are used as the feature set for training the model.
3. Model Training
Training the Model: The dataset is split into training and test sets. The Linear Regression model is trained on the training data and used to make predictions on the test data.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using the R² score, which helps to assess the performance of the model.

Model Evaluation
The model’s performance is evaluated using R² score, which measures how well the model’s predictions match the actual values.
# Evaluation Metric: R² score
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2_score(Y_test, predictions)
A high R² score indicates that the model is performing well and making accurate predictions

Conclusion
In this project, we used Linear Regression to predict car prices based on various features. Although a simple model, it provides valuable insights into how different factors affect the price of a car. Future improvements could involve experimenting with more complex models, adding additional features, or performing hyperparameter tuning.
